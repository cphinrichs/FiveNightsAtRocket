Game style:
- top-down game where the player can walk around and interact with items (like Undertale)
- there are enemies that chase the player based on certain conditions
- player can open cameras like in Five Nights at Freddy's

Map:
- five rooms: office, break room, meeting room, classroom, hallway
- break room has refrigerator and cabinets where the player can restock snacks and grab an egg
- meeting room has camera to watch what is happening in other rooms
- classroom has laptop that player has to use to work on coding project or to watch youtube
- office has Jeromathy's desk

Enemies:
- Main character is Brenton
- Jo-nathan kills the player unless the player has an egg, in which case he goes back to the classroom to eat it
- If Jeromathy sees the snacks are depleted, he will chase and kill you; he regularly walks around the office and pauses at his desk
- Angellica will kill you if she sees you on Youtube

Mechanics:
- Opening cameras drains a battery from 100%
- If battery is 0%, you die
- Watching youtube in the classroom makes time pass more quickly
- Time slowly passes from 9am to 5pm and the player has to survive until 5pm to go home
- There are five levels of Monday through Friday that must be completed to Watching
- Add more mechanics as needed
