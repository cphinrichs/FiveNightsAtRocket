Image Assets Directory
======================

Place the following image file here:
- hallway.jpg: A wide horizontal image for the panning hallway camera background
  
The hallway.jpg image will be used as a scrolling background when viewing the hallway on the security camera.
It should be a horizontal image (wider than it is tall) for the best panning effect.

If the image is not present, the camera will still function but without the background animation.
