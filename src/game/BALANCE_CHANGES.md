# Game Balance Changes - Difficulty Adjustment

## Summary of Changes

The game has been rebalanced to provide a fairer, more strategic experience that prevents spawn-killing and gives players time to learn the mechanics.

## Enemy Behavior Changes

### 1. **Activation Delays** (No More Spawn Kills!)
- **Jo-nathan**: 5-second delay before starting to chase
- **Jeromathy**: 8-second delay before starting patrol
- **Angellica**: 10-second delay before becoming active

This gives players ~5-10 seconds at the start of each day to:
- Orient themselves
- Plan their route
- Get to the break room safely
- Collect initial resources

### 2. **Reduced Enemy Speeds**

#### Jo-nathan (Orange)
- Speed: 90 → **60** (33% slower)
- Now easier to outrun and kite
- Still poses a threat but more manageable

#### Jeromathy (Blue)
- Base speed: 70 → **50** (29% slower)
- Angry speed: 110 → **85** (23% slower)
- Delayed anger trigger: Must check after 10 seconds (not instant)
- Periodically returns to his desk in the Office
- Stays at desk for 5 seconds, then patrols for 10 seconds

#### Angellica (Purple)
- Speed: 100 → **70** (30% slower)
- Now has a desk in the Hallway
- Returns to desk every 15 seconds
- Stays at desk for 8 seconds
- Moves at half speed when returning to desk
- Only chases when player is actively watching YouTube

### 3. **Jo-nathan Egg Mechanic Enhancement**

**Before:** Egg instantly pacified Jo-nathan
**After:** Egg makes Jo-nathan eat for 10 seconds
- Jo-nathan enters "eating" state
- Returns to classroom to eat
- Cannot chase or catch player while eating
- Provides a 10-second safe window
- Can be fed again after eating is complete

### 4. **New Desk Mechanics**

**Jeromathy's Desk** (Office)
- Returns to desk periodically
- Stays there for 5 seconds
- Predictable behavior pattern

**Angellica's Desk** (Hallway - NEW!)
- Has her own desk now
- Returns every 15 seconds
- Stays for 8 seconds
- Creates safe windows to watch YouTube when she's at desk

### 5. **Visual Feedback Improvements**

**Enemy Eyes Color-Coded by State:**
- **Red eyes** = Chasing (DANGER!)
- **Yellow/White eyes** = Idle/At desk/Eating (SAFE)
- **Orange eyes** = Patrolling (CAUTION)

**State Indicators (top-right corner of enemy):**
- **Red dot** = Chasing
- **Green dot** = Eating or at desk
- **Yellow dot** = Idle

## Strategic Gameplay Improvements

### Opening Strategy (First ~10 seconds)
1. You have 5-10 seconds before enemies activate
2. Go directly to Break Room
3. Grab egg from cabinet
4. Stock up on snacks from refrigerator
5. Return to safe area

### Mid-Game Strategy
- Track enemy desk timers
- Use cameras when enemies are at desks
- Feed Jo-nathan early for 10-second reprieve
- Keep 2-3 snacks in inventory (buffer)
- Watch YouTube only when Angellica is at her desk

### Resource Management
- **Eggs**: Use proactively, not reactively
- **Snacks**: Keep buffer of 2-3 to prevent panic
- **Battery**: Use cameras during enemy idle times

## Difficulty Progression

The game now has a natural difficulty curve:

**Early Game (Minutes 0-2):**
- Enemies inactive or at desks
- Safe resource collection
- Learning phase

**Mid Game (Minutes 2-5):**
- Enemies begin patrolling
- Need to track positions
- Resource management critical

**Late Game (Minutes 5+):**
- More aggressive behavior
- Tighter resource margins
- Strategic camera use essential

## Testing Notes

The changes make the game:
- ✅ More approachable for new players
- ✅ Less frustrating (no instant deaths)
- ✅ More strategic (timing matters)
- ✅ Still challenging (requires planning)
- ✅ More predictable (desk routines)
- ✅ Fairer (activation delays)

Players should now be able to:
- Learn mechanics without instant failure
- Develop strategies
- React to enemy movements
- Feel accomplishment when succeeding

## Recommended First-Time Player Strategy

1. **Day 1 Opening (0:00-0:15):**
   - Don't panic! Enemies won't chase immediately
   - Go to Break Room (through hallway)
   - Get egg from cabinet
   - Get 2-3 snacks from refrigerator
   - Return to office or meeting room

2. **Resource Maintenance:**
   - Keep egg in inventory
   - Keep 2-3 snacks minimum
   - Restock when safe

3. **Enemy Management:**
   - Feed Jo-nathan early for breathing room
   - Watch for Jeromathy at his desk
   - Check cameras when Angellica is at desk
   - Use YouTube strategically (when safe)

4. **Camera Usage:**
   - Check during enemy idle times
   - Don't stay too long (battery drain)
   - Quick checks are better than long stares

Good luck surviving at Rocket! 🚀
